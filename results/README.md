## Data files
Files                  | Description
-----------------------|------------
`####-####.bat`        | Batch files for running the training data files though Period04.
`####-####.per`        | The calcuations generated by Period04, including freqencies, for training data.
`training.per`         | All of the Period04 calculations for the training data.
`training-periods.dat` | The periods calculated for the training data.
`test.bat`             | Batch file for running the test data through Period04.
`test.per`             | The calculations generated by Period04 for the test data.
`test-periods.dat`     | The periods for the test data.
`function.py`          | The script for generating graphs of the probability function.
`graph*`               | Graphs of the probability function.

## Usage
To use `function.py` to generate graphs of the probability function, run it and supply the desired output file type (defaults to `pdf`).

```
$ python function.py png
```
